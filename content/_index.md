I'm [Emil](https://ehmiiz.se/about) and here, you'll find a variety of topics that I'm passionate about, including:

- [PowerShell](https://jsnover.com/Docs/MonadManifesto.pdf)
- [Windows Server](https://petri.com/category/windows-server)
- [Active Directory](https://joeware.net/)
- [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/)
- [.NET](https://www.hanselman.com/)
- [Linux](https://pop.system76.com/)
- [Frame.work](https://frame.work/about)

My goal is to educate the reader and myself, around these topics.

I hope you enjoy your stay here.

If you have any questions about any of the blog posts or just want to chat, feel free to send me a private message on any social media platform. I'd love to hear from you!
