## The Elastic Type System

Notes:

- What does elastic type system mean
- Example of verbose syntax with command line equivalent
- Verb-Noun syntax
- Super long cmdlet names
- Why they are bound to happen
- Aliases, transitional and convenience
- Auto complete on capitilized noun: g-ADF[tab]

TLDR;
- Type out something fast (interactively), or
- Write code that you/other people can read easily



### Happy coding
