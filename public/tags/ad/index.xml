      <description>Idea behind this post As an Active Directory professional, I have gained insights into its unsecure features and outdated legacy “ideas,” as well as the growing list of vulnerabilities in the ADDS, ADCS &amp;amp; ADFS suite.
In this post, I will share my knowledge and experience in defending Active Directory with other AD admins. Each vulnerability section will be divided into three parts: Problem, Solution, and Script.
Please note that this post is personal and subject to change.</description>
