      <description>Disclaimer: Please note that while these steps have been provided to assist you, I cannot guarantee that they will work flawlessly in every scenario. Always proceed with caution and make sure to back up your data before making any significant changes to your system.&#xA;Written on 2024-05-08 (Note: Information may become outdated soon, and this was just my approach)&#xA;If you&amp;rsquo;re a proud owner of the 2024 Asus Rog Zephyrus G16 (GU605MI) and running Fedora 40+, ensuring smooth functionality of essential features like sound, keyboard, screen brightness, and asusctl might require a bit (hehe) of tweaking.</description>

      <description>Git is a powerful and popular version control system, sometimes a bit too powerful.&#xA;Depending on how your day went, you may want to restore a file from git to a previous state, either because you made an oopsie, want to undo some changes, or need to compare different versions.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s go through four common scenarios on how to do just that!&#xA;Scenario 1: Saved Locally on the Local Git Repository The simplest scenario is when you have saved your file locally on your local git repository, but have not staged or committed it yet.</description>

      <description>Once again, meet Labmil. 2021, I wrote about my script to generate hyper-v VMs. I still use this way of creating my labs, and I think the simple nature of it is valuable.&#xA;The only requirements to using it is PowerShell, git and an iso file. Since it&amp;rsquo;s specifically a hyper-v script, naturally it will require Windows.&#xA;# Clone labmil git clone https://github.com/ehmiiz/labmil.git # Set iso path to desired VM OS $IsoPath = &amp;#34;C:\Temp\WS2022.</description>

      <description>PSCustomObject, valuable skill PSCustomObject is a feature in PowerShell that allows you to create structured data in a simple way.&#xA;There&amp;rsquo;s a ton to cover on the topic, but if your unfamiliar with it, first of all it&amp;rsquo;s probably one of the most important thing to spend time on understanding in PowerShell, secondly the PowerShell docs cover it very well.&#xA;In this blog post, I will cover a trick that I frequently use when generating structured data in form of objects that can later be piped to Export-CSV, or even better, Export-Excel</description>

Most who have tried granting permissions outside of adding users to groups in Active Directory would probably agree that, access delegation can be a daunting task.&#xA;Your best bet is to use the Delegation wizard, but wheres the fun (PowerShell fun..) in that.

      <description>Problem As you may have guessed, this post will be about installing certificates using PowerShell.&#xA;Every year as someone working with identity topics, I am tasked with renewing certificates across the environment. Many services relies fully on valid certificates in order to function securely.&#xA;One critical service in particular that this scenario will cover is: Active Directory Federation Services, ADFS.&#xA;In most cases, you will have multiple ADFS servers, meaning, if your not automating already, you will need to install the SSL certificate manually (no fun experience on 10+ servers).</description>

      <description>Problem If you enjoy the principle of least privileges, version control and doing big infrastructural changes in a safe manner, Advanced Group Policy Management or AGPM, is an amazing tool.&#xA;AGPM itself has a few years on its back, and as we sysadmins tend to get easier and easier systems now days, legacy systems can mean complexity.&#xA;When combined with new sysadmins that has not been introduced to the concept of AGPM, uncontrolled GPOs might become a problem and the built in error messages are sadly not the greatest.</description>

      <description>Problem You have encrypted files using the &amp;ldquo;File &amp;gt; Properties &amp;gt; Advanced &amp;gt; Encrypt content to secure data&amp;rdquo; feature in Windows, and have lost your certificates in your personal certificate store.&#xA;Solution A solution to this problem is to restore the private key used for encrypting your file system (EKU: Encrypting File System 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.10.3.4 ) that was generated upon encrypting your files.&#xA;The keypair to this certificate is stored in your Personal certificate store, luckily a copy of the public key is stored in your LocalMachine certificate store.</description>

      <description>One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve always done while hacking along in the terminal is working with my command-line history. There&amp;rsquo;s quite a few ways to do so currently, so I thought i&amp;rsquo;d share some of my favorite ones.&#xA;Different ways of viewing your history To view your current sessions history, PowerShell creates an alias for the cmdlet Get-History -&amp;gt; h. Simple as that. h To view your over-all history in your current environment, PSReadLine is your friend: cat (Get-PSReadLineOption).</description>

      <description>The headache of setting up recurring GPO&amp;rsquo;s I was faced with an issue not too long ago, and I spent quite some time trying to come up with an @automated solution to the problem. I thought that some hypothetical sysadmin might find themselves in a similar situation in the future, and this might save the hypothetical person some time.&#xA;The problem I was trying to solve was the following; How do we script the task of creating a new GPO with the same base settings but with different conditions (Strings (AD Groups, Hostnames), IP&amp;rsquo;s, true/false), in an automated fasion?</description>

      <description>‚Äú.ps1 is not digitally signed. The script will not execute on the system.‚Äù This error is clearly not really a typical error, but can be a blocker, nonetheless. It&amp;rsquo;s more of a security feature than an error.&#xA;Simple solution if you&amp;rsquo;re running this script from another service, or as an Azure Runbook, before executing the Invoke-Command:&#xA;Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass&#xA;This will allow the powershell session process itself to bypass the Exec policy, and after termination the next powershell process has the default user or system policy.</description>

I read the entire book in Swedish, and although it‚Äôs only been a year since I read it, I already have an urge to re-read the whole book in English. The translations just don‚Äôt cut it for someone who‚Äôs interested in the lore of middle earth.</description>
